/**
 This protocol can be implemented to define API environments.

 An ``ApiEnvironment`` should define the root ``url`` of the
 environment, to which then the ``ApiRoute/path`` of a route
 can be applied. You can use an enum to define multiple ones
 with a single enum and use associated values to define data
 for a certain environment, such as api keys and secrets etc.
 and use the data when defining request data.

 Both ``ApiEnvironment`` and ``ApiRoute`` can define headers
 and query parameters that should be merged when the request
 is created. The environment can use this to define api keys,
 secrets etc. while the route can define route-specific data.
