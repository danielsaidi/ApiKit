 This protocol can be implemented by types that can make api
 requests and return the raw data.
 
 Use ``fetch(_:)`` to fetch raw data, and ``fetchItem(with:)``
 or ``fetchItem(at:in:)`` to fetch typed data.
 
 The protocol is implemented by `URLSession`, so you can use
 it without having to create a custom client implementation.
 
 If you must create a custom client implementation, you only
 have to implement ``fetch(_:)`` if you need to customize it.
